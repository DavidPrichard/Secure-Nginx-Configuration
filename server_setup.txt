IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/annonasoftware.com/fullchain.pem. Your cert
   will expire on 2017-11-05. To obtain a new or tweaked version of
   this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again. To
   non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run "certbot
   renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

port knocking or otherwise hiding the ssh port (knockd, knock client)


(ssh aliases?)

ssh storm? key management solutions? backup private keys with QR codes?
also: what's up with let's encrypt account nonsense?
